Examples of Cron jobs 1. Scheduling a Job For a Specific Time The basic usage of cron is to execute a job in a specific time as shown below. This will execute the Full backup shell script (full-backup) on 10th June 08:30 AM. The time field uses 24 hours format. So, for 8 AM use 8, and for 8 PM use 20.

30 08 10 06 * /home/maverick/full-backup
30 – 30th Minute 08 – 08 AM 10 – 10th Day 06 – 6th Month (June) * – Every day of the week 2.To view the Crontab entries


View Current Logged-In User’s Crontab entries : To view your crontab entries type crontab -l from your unix account. 
View Root Crontab entries : Login as root user (su – root) and do crontab -l. 
To view crontab entries of other Linux users : Login to root and use -u {username} -l. 
3.To edit Crontab Entries Edit Current Logged-In User’s Crontab entries.To edit a crontab entries, use crontab -e. By default this will edit the current logged-in users crontab.  4.To schedule a job for every minute using Cron. Ideally you may not have a requirement to schedule a job every minute. But understanding this example  will help you understand the other examples.

* * * * * CMD
The * means all the possible unit — i.e every minute of every hour through out the year. More than using this * directly, you will find it very useful in the following cases. When you specify */5 in minute field means every 5 minutes. When you specify 0-10/2 in minute field mean every 2 minutes in the first 10 minute. Thus the above convention can be used for all the other 4 fields. 5.To schedule a job for more than one time (e.g. Twice a Day) The following script take a incremental backup twice a day every day. This example executes the specified incremental backup shell script (incremental-backup) at 11:00 and 16:00 on every day. The comma separated value in a field specifies that the command needs to be executed in all the mentioned time.

00 11, 16 * * * /home/maverick/bin/incremental-backup
00 – 0th Minute (Top of the hour) 11, 16 – 11 AM and 4 PM * – Every day * – Every month * – Every day of the week 6.To schedule a job for certain range of time (e.g. Only on Weekdays) If you wanted a job to be scheduled for every hour with in a specific range of time then use the following.

Cron Job everyday during working hours : This example checks the status of the database everyday (including weekends) during the working hours 9 a.m – 6 p.m
00 09-18 * * * /home/maverick/bin/check-db-status
00 – 0th Minute (Top of the hour) 09-18 – 9 am, 10 am, 11 am, 12 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm * – Every day * – Every month * – Every day of the week
Cron Job every weekday during working hours : This example checks the status of the database every weekday (i.e excluding Sat and Sun) during the working hours 9 a.m – 6 p.m.
00 09-18 * * 1-5 /home/maverick/bin/check-db-status
00 – 0th Minute (Top of the hour) 09-18 – 9 am, 10 am, 11 am, 12 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm * – Every day * – Every month 1-5 -Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu and Fri (Every Weekday)
7.To schedule a background Cron job for every 10 minutes. Use the following, if you want to check the disk space every 10 minutes.

*/10 * * * * /home/maverick/check-disk-space
It executes the specified command check-disk-space every 10 minutes through out the year. But you may have a requirement of executing the command only during certain hours or vice versa. The above examples shows how to do those things.Instead of specifying values in the 5 fields, we can specify it using a single keyword as mentioned below. There are special cases in which instead of the above 5 fields you can use @ followed by a keyword — such as reboot, midnight, yearly, hourly. Cron special keywords and its meaning

Keyword    Equivalent
@yearly    0 0 1 1 *
@daily     0 0 * * *
@hourly    0 * * * *
@reboot    Run at startup.
8.To schedule a job for first minute of every year using @yearly If you want a job to be executed on the first minute of every year, then you can use the @yearly cron keyword as shown below.This will execute the system annual maintenance using annual-maintenance shell script at 00:00 on Jan 1st for every year.

@yearly /home/maverick/bin/annual-maintenance
9.To schedule a Cron job beginning of every month using @monthly It is as similar as the @yearly as above. But executes the command monthly once using @monthly cron keyword.This will execute the shell script tape-backup at 00:00 on 1st of every month.

@monthly /home/maverick/bin/tape-backup
10.To schedule a background job every day using @daily Using the @daily cron keyword, this will do a daily log file cleanup using cleanup-logs shell script at 00:00 on every day.

@daily /home/maverick/bin/cleanup-logs "day started"
11.To execute a linux command after every reboot using @reboot Using the @reboot cron keyword, this will execute the specified command once after the machine got booted every time.

@reboot CMD


To Check the logs of the Cron:

# tail -f /var/log/cron

To check all User cron jobs
1. ls -l /var/log/cron/
